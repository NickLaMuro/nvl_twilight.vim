nvl_twilight.vim
================

Custom "twilight" color scheme, adapted from a version by Neal Milstein, with
some helper functions by Henry So, Jr.

This scheme was extracted from the https://github.com/NickLaMuro/vim-files
project, which was a "junk drawer" of vim config files that predated by
[dotfiles][] repo, and will soon (if not already) be deprecated.


Installation
------------

Your "vim plugin manager" of choice should be able to support this like any
other color scheme.  :)

This project is available as open source under the [MIT License][] terms.  That
said, it is strictly a formality, and you are free to do with this as you like.

... though my ego would probably appreciate an small acknowledgement :)
